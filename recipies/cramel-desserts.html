    <p>This timeless dessert is the perfect marriage of a rich, velvety custard and a deep, amber-hued caramel sauce. Unlike heavier puddings, this dish offers a delicate, melt-in-your-mouth texture that balances the intense sweetness of burnt sugar with a sophisticated hint of sea salt. When inverted onto a plate, the liquid gold caramel cascades down the sides, creating a stunning presentation that looks as good as it tastes.
    </p>
    <p>It is a masterpiece of simple ingredients transformed by heat. The custard itself is infused with vanilla and a pinch of salt to cut through the richness, while the caramel layer provides a slightly bitter, complex finish that prevents the dessert from being overly sugary. Whether served at a formal dinner party or as a weekend treat, it remains the gold standard of caramel-based sweets.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Granulated sugar</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup Water</li> 
        <li>1/2 tsp Sea salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Whole milk </li>
        <li>1 cup Heavy cream </li>
        <li>4 Large eggs  </li>
        <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Granulated sugar </li>
        <li>2 tsp Vanilla extract 1/4 tsp Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Caramel: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar and water. Heat over medium-high without stirring; instead, swirl the pan occasionally until the mixture turns a deep amber color. Stir in the sea salt and immediately pour the caramel into a 9-inch round cake pan or individual ramekins, tilting to coat the bottom.</li>
        <li>Heat the Dairy: In a separate saucepan, combine the milk and heavy cream. Heat over medium until it just reaches a simmer (do not boil), then remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Mix the Custard: In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, yolks, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar until smooth but not foamy. Slowly drizzle the warm milk mixture into the eggs while whisking constantly (this is called "tempering" to prevent the eggs from scrambling).</li>
        <li>Strain and Pour: Pour the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to ensure a perfectly smooth texture. Pour the strained custard over the hardened caramel in your pan/ramekins.</li>
        <li>The Water Bath: Place the dish inside a larger roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the custard dish.</li>
        <li>Bake and Chill: Bake at 160°C (325°F) for 50–60 minutes (less for small ramekins) until the edges are set but the center still wobbles slightly. Remove from the water bath, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight).</li>
        <li>Serve: Run a thin knife around the edge of the dish. Place a serving plate over the top, quickly invert it, and let the caramel sauce flow over the custard.</li>
    </ol>
